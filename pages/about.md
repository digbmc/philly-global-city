## About the Course

“ITAL B240 Philadelphia the Global City: The Italian Legacy across Time” is a Tri-Co Philly course taught in Fall 2025. It investigates the history and evolution of Philadelphia as a globalized and multi-ethnic city, using as a case study for this analysis the impact and legacy of transnational Italian culture across the centuries. By adopting a cross-cultural, trans-historical, and interdisciplinary approach, "Philadelphia the Global City" explores the influence that—along with and in intersection with many other cultural inputs—Italian arts and cultures have exerted on the city, making it become the cosmopolitan and transnational urban environment that it is today. 

Throughout the centuries and way before Italy even started existing as a state, Philadelphians traveled to the peninsula and brought back objects to display in emerging cultural institutions or studied the country's art and architecture styles to shape the evolving aspect of the city. Simultaneously, incoming immigration formed new neighborhoods—such as South Philly, home to the Italian Market—and Italian figures came to prominence and became part of the social fabric of the city. Nowadays, many non-profit organizations work to preserve the traces that Italian migrants left within Philadelphia's multi-ethnic urban environment as well as to extend the city's global profile and celebrate its heritage and diversity. 

Through specific field trips, on-site experiential activities, and forms of civic engagement the course highlights both the enduring fascination of Philadelphians with Italy (or with the idea thereof) across the centuries and the role that the Italian Diaspora played in the development of the city. The course ultimately challenges geographical, chronological, and cultural boundaries by showing how places, arts, identities that today are perceived as 'American' have in most cases an intersectional, multi-ethnic, and cross-cultural history to tell.

## Who We Are

He was born and raised in Rome, Italy, and moved to Philadelphia in 2022, quickly falling under its spell. Luca enjoys reading, studying, and researching about the city’s history and arts, and was elated to be able to transfer his passion and knowledge into this course, while learning from the students’ diverse ideas, gazes, and researches.

<span id="willa-bywater" class="bio-id fw-bold">Willa Bywater</span> (any/all), BMC '27, is a History major and Museum Studies minor with an interest in working-class history and the formation of regional cultures and identities. They are neither Italian nor Philadelphian, but were born in Chicago and raised in Maine, and like to describe their ethnic background as "a long line of very cold people who ate a lot of potatoes." Nevertheless, they have truly enjoyed getting to know Philadelphia better through this course, and would like to extend a particular thanks to the people of the 9th Street Market for their kindness and delicious food.

<span id="natalie-cincotta" class="bio-id fw-bold">Natalie Cincotta</span> (she/her), BMC '26, is an Art History Major and Museum Studies minor with classwork in Italian language and culture. Born in western New York, she was raised around Rochester NY and took frequent trips to East Coast cities with her father. Instilled with a love for community culture through theater, Natalie was eager to learn about the people involved in Italian culture of Philadelphia. Combining her knowledge of Art History and Italian helped her research the Fountain of the Seahorses which she was drawn to through previous knowledge of Italian fountains, and love for hidden historical monuments.

<span id="lucy-dellera" class="bio-id fw-bold">Lucy Dellera</span> (they/she), BMC '28, is a Biology and Geology double major and a Transnational Italian studies minor. They are from a small town in Western Pennsylvania, and have always been curious about cities as a cultural hub. When they moved to Bryn Mawr for college, Lucy chose to do the Trico Philly Program to make sure they could take advantage of the amazing things the city has to offer. Through the program, they have learned so much about Italian American History, and all of the things that make Philadelphia the city it is today.
