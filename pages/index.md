This website is the culmination of a semester's worth of research by students in "ITAL B240 Philadelphia the Global City: The Italian Legacy across Time," a Tri-Co Philly course taught in Fall 2025. It investigates the history and evolution of Philadelphia as a globalized and multi-ethnic city, using as a case study for this analysis the impact and legacy of transnational Italian culture across the centuries. The website features an [interactive map]({{ '/map.html' | relative_url }}) of key locations, artworks, and other points of interest related to the Italian legacy in Philadelphia along with student research on each point of interest. It also features a [collection of locations and images]({{ '/browse.html' | relative_url }}), including photographs taken by the students as well as some found in the course of their research.

By adopting a cross-cultural, trans-historical, and interdisciplinary approach, the students in the course explored the influence that—along with and in intersection with many other cultural inputs—Italian arts and cultures have exerted on the city, making it become the cosmopolitan and transnational urban environment that it is today. Throughout the centuries and way before Italy even started existing as a state, Philadelphians traveled to the peninsula and brought back objects to display in emerging cultural institutions or studied the country's art and architecture styles to shape the evolving aspect of the city. Simultaneously, incoming immigration formed new neighborhoods—such as South Philly, home to the Italian Market—and Italian figures came to prominence and became part of the social fabric of the city. Nowadays, many non-profit organizations work to preserve the traces that Italian migrants left within Philadelphia's multi-ethnic urban environment as well as to extend the city's global profile and celebrate its heritage and diversity. Through specific field trips, on-site experiential activities, and forms of civic engagement the course highlighted both the enduring fascination of Philadelphians with Italy (or with the idea thereof) across the centuries and the role that the Italian Diaspora played in the development of the city. This project ultimately challenges geographical, chronological, and cultural boundaries by showing how places, arts, identities that today are perceived as 'American' have in most cases an intersectional, multi-ethnic, and cross-cultural history to tell.
