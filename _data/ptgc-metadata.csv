The Palumbo Family's legacy of humanitarian efforts began here in 1884 with Antonio who received hundreds of Italian immigrants into his boardinghouse. Frank, his grandson, (1910-1983), expanded the boardinghouse into the restaurant/nightclub complex and brought top-named entertainers from all over the world. His motto, ""If I stop giving. I stop living. defined the extent of his philanthropy, notably with the Philadelphia Zoo and orphans.
Three fires in 1994 destroyed only the physical structures but not the ""Nostalgia"".
